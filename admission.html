                        <p>Seth Juggilal Poddar Academy (ICSE) follows an academic calendar of April to March with the
                            summer vacation in April end to June. The school has a fortnight long Diwali vacation in
                            October/November and another fortnight long Christmas vacation in December/January. This
                            academic calender is indicative and is subject to change.</p>

                        <div class="well">SCHOOL UNIFORM</div>

                        <p>We believe that the wearing of school uniform, gives children a unique identity. Children
                            feel
                            proud to belong to a good school and the wearing of school uniform is a clear indication
                            that
                            they belong to that school. The colour and pattern of the uniform will be displayed on the
                            Notice Board at appropriate time.</p>
