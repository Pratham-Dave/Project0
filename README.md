# Implementation Details

This website consists of the following components:
- Four HTML Pages
- Two CSS Files
- One SCSS File
- Hyperlinks
- Buttons
- Few images (which are included in images folder)
- Bootstrap components
- Media queries

## Using CSS
CSS has been used in this website for styling. Whatever colours, fonts, margins, padding you can see is because of the CSS.CSS has been linked into every HTML file so that every file gets the attributes of the CSS file.

## Using SCSS
SCSS file has been added because a variable can be added in an SCSS file which further helps in reducing the code. But as the browsers do not support SCSS files, so they are converted to CSS file and then are implemented in the program.
Syntax for making a CSS file from SCSS
- git sass color.scss color.css (this creates a new CSS file of the SCSS file.)
